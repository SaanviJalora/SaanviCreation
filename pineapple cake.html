<h2>Preparing the cake with cream</h2>
<h3>Prepare the cake:</h3>
<p>Sift the flour and baking powder and transfer into a mixing bowl.
Add the salt, sugar, butter, water and vanilla.
Beat the mixture using a wooden spoon or a beater till well blended.
Add the yogurt to the cake batter and beat till smooth. The batter looks almost glossy when done. Transfer the batter into the prepared tins.
Either you can make two cakes or slice one cake into halves. Bake for about 20-25 minutes at 160 degree Celsius.</p>
<h3>Prpeare the layering:</h3>
<p>Whip the cream with the sugar, till it holds its shape.
Be careful not to over beat, as it will turn into butter.
Place one sponge on the plate upside down, remove the paper and spread the chopped pineapple over it in a layer.
Spread a layer of cream over this and cover with the second sponge, upside down. Remove the paper and sprinkle with the juice/syrup.
Now cover neatly with a layer of cream. Cut into desired sized rectangles and decorate with piped whipped cream.
Garnish with the pineapple slice and cherries, chill and serve.</p>
